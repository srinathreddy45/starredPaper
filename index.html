The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. 
The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males
 exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight,[5] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger, barring hybrids 
 like the liger.[6][7] Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered
 remnant population resides in and around Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their 
 range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern 
 Europe to India. For more information on Lions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion" target="_blank">click here</a>.
